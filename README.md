Repository for STScI Training
-----------------------------

This repository houses the files for my professional site at the Institute.
The purpose of placing the source files in this repository is as follows:

* Experiment with version control for websites
* Use as a testbed for features before making them live
* Experiment with automatic page changes (such as adding/removing elements from the
  site menu in a site-wide manner, and adding automatic "Page Updated" notification
  to every page).
